Welcome to How Bout Them Apples, where every apple is crafted with love and a touch of family tradition. Since 2003, I've been creating delectable caramel and chocolate-covered apples, starting as a simple gesture of love for my family during Christmas. Little did I know that this sweet endeavor would blossom into a cherished business, thanks to the overwhelming support and enthusiasm from my sisters, coworkers, and, eventually, a growing circle of delighted customers.

The journey from a family favorite to a beloved brand has been nothing short of magical. In 2021, I took a leap of faith and ventured into craft shows, where I found immense joy in sharing my creations and witnessing the smiles they brought to people's faces. The name "How Bout Them Apples" was a stroke of genius from my brother-in-law, capturing the playful spirit and homemade goodness of my treats.

At the heart of How Bout Them Apples is my family. My son and my boyfriend are my steadfast companions at every show, providing the muscle and support that keep this dream alive. Their dedication and encouragement of my entire family fuel my passion and drive me to perfection.

Quality is at the core of every apple I make. I meticulously handpick each fruit, ensuring it's free from bruises and ready to be transformed into a mouthwatering masterpiece. Your satisfaction is my top priority, and I'm committed to making things right if you ever find an error.

To all my customers, thank you for being a special part of this journey. Your support means the world to me, and I look forward to continuing to sweeten your lives with every apple I make.

With love and gratitude,
